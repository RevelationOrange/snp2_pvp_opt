this is a project to make a program that can do what the python version I wrote does, only in a reasonable amount of time

here's the python code: https://gist.github.com/RevelationOrange/220a84d7b4a67ef20ef3

I want to set it up so anyone can contribute changes, it seems like github is a good way to do that
